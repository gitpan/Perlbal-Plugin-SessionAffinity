=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Perlbal> doesn't support session affinity (or otherwise known as "sticky
sessions") out of the box. There is a plugin on CPAN called
L<Perlbal::Plugin::StickySessions> but there are a few problems with it.

This plugin should be do a much better job. Go ahead and read why you should
use this one and how it works.

=head1 WHY YOU SHOULD USE IT

Here are things that are unique in this plugin. I am comparing this with the
current available session affinity implementation available on CPAN
(L<Perlbal::Plugin::StickySessions>).

=over 4

=item * It supports session affinity for all requests

Unlike the other plugin, this one uses a proper hook that supports not just
file fetching, but for each and every request.

=item * No patches required

Unlike the other plugin, that comes with two patches (which were not
integrated into L<Perlbal> core), this one requires no patches whatsoever.

=item * It's up-to-date

Unlike the other plugin, that still requires a patch that includes a hook that
was already introduced (which shows it's clearly outdated), this plugin is
very much up to speed with things.

=item * It's thin and sane

Unlike the other plugin, which is mostly copy-pasted from some handling code
in L<Perlbal> itself (seriously!), this module contains no copy-pasted code,
is much smaller and leaner, and is much less likely to break between new
versions of Perlbal.

=item * No breakage

Unlike the other plugin, which - after close inspection - seemed breakable
(to say the least, since connect-aheads don't seem to get cleaned up), this
plugin uses a completely different method which emphasizes correctness and
the least intervention with Perlbal itself, and keeps Perlbal in charge of
the critical operations.

=item * Much less security risk

Unlike the other plugin, which sets a cookie with the backend ID correlating
to the backend order in the pool, this plugin uses SHA1 checksum IDs (with an
optionally randomly-created salt) for each server, and allows you to change the
header name and add a checksum salt (whether randomly-created or your own) for
the cookie.

This makes it harder for an attacker to understand what the header represents
and how many backends exist (since there is no counter).

=item * Features

Unlike the other plugin, that simply has things hardcoded, this plugin allows
to change both the header name and the salt used to create the ID. By default
the salt is off but you can turn it on and then either use a randomly-created
one or set your own.

=back

=head1 HOW DOES IT WORK

=head2 Basic stuff

Basically, the module creates a SHA1 checksum for each backend node, and
provides the user with a cookie request. If the user provides that cookie in
return, it will try and find and provide the user with that specific node.

If the node is no longer in the service's pool, or the cookie matches a node
that doesn't exist, it will provide the user with a cookie again.

=head2 Advanced stuff

The plugin sets up dedicated pools and services for each service's node. This
is required since Perlbal has no way of actually allowing you to specify the
node a user will go to, only the service. Not to worry, this creation is done
lazily so it saves as much memory as it can.

When a user comes in with a cookie of a node that exist in the service's pool
it will create a pool for it (if one doesn't exist), and a matching service
for it (if one doesn't exist) and then direct to user to it.

The check against nodes and pools is done live and not against the static
configuration file. This means that if you're playing with the pools (changing
them live, for example), it will still work just fine.

A new service is created using configurations from the existing service. The
more interesting details is that reuse is emphasized so no new sockets are
created and instead this new service uses the already existing sockets (along
with existing connections) instead of firing new ones. It doesn't open a new
socket for listening or anything like that. This also means your SSL
connections work seamlessly. Yes, it's insanely cool, I know! :)

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 affinity_cookie_header

The name of the cookie header for the session.

Default: B<X-SERVERID>.

=head2 affinity_use_salt

Whether to use a salt or not when calculating SHA1 IDs.

    # both are equal
    affinity_use_salt = 1
    affinity_use_salt = yes

    # opposite meaning
    affinity_use_salt = 0
    affinity_use_salt = no

Default: B<no>.

=head2 affinity_salt

The salt that is used to create the backend's SHA1 IDs.

Default: the following code is run when you load
L<Perlbal::Plugin::SessionAffinity> to create the salt on start up:

    join q{}, map { $_ = rand 999; s/\.//; $_ } 1 .. 10;

If you want predictability with salt, you can override it as such:

    affinity_salt = helloworld

    # now the calculation will be:
    my $sha1 = sha1hex( $salt . $ip . $port );

=head2 affinity_use_domain

Uses domain-mode for finding the backend. This is an alternate way of
deciding the backend, which enables backends to persist per domain,
allowing you to avoid a fragmented cache. If you have a lot of cache misses
because of jumping between backends, try turning this feature on.

This feature ignores the cookie provided (and does not provide its own
cookie) since backends are decided by the domain name alone.

    # both are equal
    affinity_use_domain = 1
    affinity_use_domain = yes

    # opposite meaning
    affinity_use_domain = 0
    affinity_use_domain = no

Default: B<no>.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 register

Registers our events.

=head2 unregister

Unregister our hooks and setters events.

=head2 get_ip_port

Parses a request's cookies and finds the specific cookie relating to session
affinity and get the backend details via the ID in the cookie.

=head2 find_backend_by_id

Given a SHA1 ID, find the correct backend to which it belongs.

=head2 find_backend_by_domain_id

Given a SHA1 ID for a domain, find the correct backend to which it belongs.

=head2 create_id

Creates a SHA1 checksum ID using L<Digest::SHA>. The checksum is composed
of the IP, port and salt. If you want to have more predictability, you can
provide a salt of C<0> or C<string> and then the checksum would be predictable.

This should make it clear on how it's created:

    if ( $has_salt ) {
        $checksum = sha1sum( $salt . "$ip:$port" );
    } else {
        $checksum = sha1sum( "$ip:$port" );
    }

=head2 create_domain_id

Same concept as the above C<create_id> function, except for the following
changes:

Accepts a domain and a list of nodes (which is assumed to be ordered), uses the
C<domain_index> function to get the index in the nodes of a domain and picks
the correct node from the list it receives by index.

=head2 domain_index

This function tries to fetch an index number for a given domain name. It
accepts a domain name and the maximum index number.

It translates the domain name to a long number, and uses mod (C<%>) on it.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=head2 Perlbal

Obviously.

=head2 CGI::Cookies

To parse and create cookies.

=head2 Digest::SHA

To provide a SHA1 checksum.

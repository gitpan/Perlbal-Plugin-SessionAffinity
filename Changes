Revision history for Perl extension Perlbal::Plugin::SessionAffinity

0.003   14.07.12
        * Docs reversal.

0.002   12.07.12
        * affinity_cookie_header and affinity_salt are now production.
          (the worked before, but now they're documented to be working)
        * Removing pluggable fetching of backends since Perlbal already
          picks them up without asking us and the user should actually
          play with the pool if s/he want such stuff.
        * Lots of code fixups/cleanups.
        * Some docs fixups. Expect more. :)

0.001   11.07.12
        * Works, damn it!

0.007   21.10.12

0.006   11.10.12
        * Add "domain mode" - use_domain to handle fragmented cache.
        * Doc fixes/cleanups.

0.005   01.08.12
        * Affinity salt is now off by default.
        * You can now set salt on using AFFINITY_USE_SALT.
        * Make configurations more relaxed by allowing prefixed spaces.
        * Remove Carp dependency, it wasn't used.

0.004   15.07.12
        * Fix crash caused by "use fields" in Perlbal. Pfff...

0.003   14.07.12
        * Docs reversal.

0.002   12.07.12
        * affinity_cookie_header and affinity_salt are now production.
          (the worked before, but now they're documented to be working)
        * Removing pluggable fetching of backends since Perlbal already
          picks them up without asking us and the user should actually
          play with the pool if s/he want such stuff.
        * Lots of code fixups/cleanups.
        * Some docs fixups. Expect more. :)
